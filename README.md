# Slipee

Slipee is a server, CLI tool and GO package for making static maps from a [slippy map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map) type tile server.

## Motivation

Slipee fills the need for a server (microservice) to serve static images to backend services in the [EIND](eind.no) tech stack. It is designed to do one thing, and one thing only:

> Provide static map images from a OSM-type tile server with a single, customizable, marker in the center of the image. The size and zoom of the image is adjustable.

## Alternatives

Check out the the list over at [Open Street Map wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Static_map_images). There are some pretty good alternatives.

## The name

_Slipee_ is taken from the [phonetic respelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling) of the word _slippy_, referring to a [slippy map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map) map. Slipee is prononced as is, but in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), its / ˈslɪp i /
